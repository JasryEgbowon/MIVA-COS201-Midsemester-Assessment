#  C Programming Guide. Mainly for Student Record System 
*this is a guide for anyone especially members of this group to go through and get a brief overview of the C programming Languagae an it's use in this project*

## Introduction to C for Our Project

Hey team! This guide will walk you through the C programming concepts we used in our Student Record System. Every concept here is directly tied to our project code.

---

##  **1. Basic Structure of Our Program**

### What is C Programming Language? Week1
 C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It was initially designed for the UNIX operating system and has since become one of the most widely used and influential programming languages.  <br/>
C is like giving precise instructions to a computer. Our program follows this pattern:

```c
#include <stdio.h>   // Contains: Input/output functions (printf, scanf)
#include <stdlib.h>  //Contains: Standard library functions
#include <string.h>  // Contains: String operations

// Our main program starts here
int main() {
    // All our code goes here
    return 0;
}
```

**In our project:** This structure gives us the tools to create menus, handle user input, and manage student data.

##  **2. Data Types & Variables - Storing Student Information**

### Basic Data Types Used in C:
```c
char name[50];      // Stores text (student names)
int rollNumber;     // Stores whole numbers (roll numbers)
float marks;        // Stores decimal numbers (marks)
```

**Example Used in our code:**
```c
Student newStudent;
printf("Enter student name: ");
scanf("%s", newStudent.name);        // %s for strings
printf("Enter roll number: ");
scanf("%d", &newStudent.rollNumber); // %d for integers
printf("Enter marks: ");
scanf("%f", &newStudent.marks);      // %f for decimals
```
Each data type is chosen specifically for what it stores - names need text, roll numbers need whole numbers, marks need decimals.

## **3. Structs - Creating Student "Containers"** COS201(Computer Programming) Week3: Data Types and Variables

### What's a Struct?
A struct lets us combine different data types into one package - perfect for representing a student!

```c
// example for a student
typedef struct {
    char name[50];
    int rollNumber;
    float marks;
} Student;
```

**In our project:**
- We created a `Student` struct that holds name, roll number, and marks together
- This lets us treat each student as a single unit rather than separate variables

---

## **4. Arrays - Storing Multiple Students** Week 4- COS201- Computer programming

### What are Arrays? 
Arrays let us store multiple values of the same type. We use them to store our student list.

```c
Student students[MAX_STUDENTS];  // Array that can hold 100 students
int studentCount = 0;           // Tracks how many students we have
```

**How we use it:**
```c
// Adding a student to our array
students[studentCount] = newStudent;
studentCount++;  // Move to next position
```

**Real benefit:** Without arrays, we'd need separate variables for each student - imagine `student1`, `student2`, `student3`... up to 100!

---

## **5. Functions - Organizing Our Code** Week5 COS201- Computer programming

### What are Functions?
Functions are mini-programs within our main program that handle a specific tasks in our code:

**From our code:**
```c
void addStudent() { /* handles adding new students */ }
void displayAllStudents() { /* shows all students */ }
void searchStudent() { /* finds students by roll number */ }
```

**Why we use them:**
- **Organization:** Each function does one specific job
- **Reusability:** We can call `displayAllStudents()` anytime
- **Debugging:** If search breaks, we know to check `searchStudent()`

##  **6. Control Flow - Making Decisions** 100 Level Second semester COS 102- Problem solving Week9-Control FLow

### If/Else Statements:
```c
if(students[i].marks >= PASS_MARK) {
    printf("PASS");
} else {
    printf("FAIL");
}
```

### Switch Statement (Our Menu):
```c
switch(choice) {
    case 1: addStudent(); break;
    case 2: displayAllStudents(); break;
    // ... other cases
    default: printf("Invalid choice!\n");
}
```

**In practice:** This is how our program "decides" what to do based on user input.

---

## **7. Loops - Repeating Actions** COS201-(Computer Programming) Week4: Lab4- Loops and Iterations 

### For Loops (Displaying All Students):
```c
for(int i = 0; i < studentCount; i++) {
    printf("Name: %s, Marks: %.2f\n", students[i].name, students[i].marks);
}
```

### Do-While Loop (Main Menu):
```c
do {
    // Show menu and get choice
    // Process choice
} while(choice != 9);  // Keep running until user chooses 9 (exit)
```

**Real use:** Loops let us handle multiple students without repeating code.

---

## **8. File I/O - Saving & Loading Data** COS201-(Computer Programming)  Week6-Basic/Input and String Processing
An example has been used to illustrate thos
### An example of Saving to File:
```c
FILE *file = fopen("records.txt", "w");  // Open file for writing
fprintf(file, "%s %d %.2f\n", student.name, student.rollNumber, student.marks);
fclose(file);  // Always close the file!
```

### Example of Loading from File:
```c
FILE *file = fopen("records.txt", "r");  // Open file for reading
while(fscanf(file, "%s %d %f", name, &roll, &marks) == 3) {
    // Read until we have 3 successful conversions
}
```

**Why this matters:** Without file operations, our data disappears when the program closes!

---

## **9. Examples of the Key Concepts used in Action**

### Search Function:
```c
int findStudentByRoll(int rollNumber) {
    for(int i = 0; i < studentCount; i++) {
        if(students[i].rollNumber == rollNumber) {
            return i;  // Found the student!
        }
    }
    return -1;  // Student not found
}
```
In the code it:
1. Loop through all students
2. Compare each student's roll number with what we're searching for
3. Return position if found, -1 if not found

## **10. Common Errors & Solutions in C Programming Language**

### Error: "Variable not declared"
**Solution:** Make sure you declare variables before using them

### Error: "Missing semicolon"
**Solution:** Every statement needs a `;` at the end

### Error: "Segmentation fault" 
**Solution:** Usually means accessing array beyond its size - check your loops!

### Error: "File not opening"
**Solution:** Check if file exists and you have permission to access it

## **11. Connecting Concepts to Requirements**

| Assignment Requirement | C Concept Used | Our Implementation |
|-----------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Store student info | Structs + Arrays | `Student` struct + `students[]` array |
| Input/Output | printf/scanf | Menu system + data entry |
| Multiple students | Loops + Arrays | `for` loops + student array |
| File operations | File I/O | `fprintf`/`fscanf` functions |

## **Next Steps After reading this**

1. **Understand our code** - read through `student_record_system.c`
2. **Try small changes** - modify the pass mark, add new fields
3. **Test edge cases** - what happens with negative marks? Empty names?
4. **Extend functionality** - maybe add email fields or subject-wise marks
